/// overlay has no earlier family, and PingFang is proportional, so every
/// cell is stretched (ghostty#12694). iOS already falls back to PingFang
/// stably; it does not need the map.

/// The font size is written here as well as into the surface options. The
/// library's base config carries its own `font-size` (10 on every iOS-family
/// build, Catalyst included), and the surface option only overrides it at
/// the surface's birth: every later config reload — the colour scheme the
/// view reports on mount, a theme change — reapplies the *file* to the
/// surface, and a file without the preference reset the first terminal to
/// the library's size. A later line wins in ghostty, so this one does.
